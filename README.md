# Task List Manager

## Description: It is necessary to create a web page for creating and using task lists.

## The task should be done in JavaScript + HTML + CSS without using third-party frameworks and libraries.

## The page should work and look the same in FF, Edge and Chrome.

## Requirements:
1) The user should be able to create and use task lists.
2) Each list should have an editable title, a counter of the number of tasks
(completed/total) and the set of tasks themselves.
3) In addition to the main text, each task has a status (completed/active). Tasks can
be created, deleted and edited by the user, and can also change their status.
4) The names of the lists along with their contents and task statuses should be saved by the browser when
the page is reloaded.
5) Tasks marked as completed should visually differ from active ones (for example,
by background color, font or other styles).
